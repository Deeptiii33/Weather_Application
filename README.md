A simple weather application using the openweather API.

STEPS to create an account for the openweather API

1. Go to https://openweathermap.org
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to the API keys section
4. Generate a key
5. Copy that key to clipboard
6. Insert that key into the required variable in the script.js file.
Tip: After API is generated you need to wait for few hours for it to get activated completely (it took me around 2 hours)
      But make sure you use it in code first and if it does'nt work kindly wait.
